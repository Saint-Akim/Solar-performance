## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If Upload Fails:
- Try uploading files one by one
- Ensure you're signed into GitHub
- Check file sizes (should all be under 25MB)

### If Deploy Fails:
- Verify main file path is exactly: app_enhanced.py
- Check that requirements.txt was uploaded
- Wait 2-3 minutes for initial deployment

### Need Help?
- GitHub Docs: https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces
